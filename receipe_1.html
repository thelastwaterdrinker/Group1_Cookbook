        <title>Green Smoothie</title>
        <p>Do you ever find it challenging to eat all of your recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables each
            day? Sometimes I do. And, I admit it. I’m a little late to the game on this one. </p>

            <p> For years I’ve been hearing people talk about adding greens like kale or spinach to their morning smoothies,
            saying, “You don’t even know it’s in there.” Well, I didn’t buy it. Until, I tried it. Now, greens are a
            regular feature in my morning smoothies.</p>

            <p>Adding plain Greek yogurt along with the fruits and spinach increases the protein content, making this
            smoothie an easy and fulfilling meal. You can sneak all kinds of other good things in, too. </p>

            <p>Many parents find green smoothies are an enticing way to get their young ones to eat an extra serving of
            greens.</p>

            <p>Do you slip greens into your smoothies? If so, please tell us about it in the comments.</p>
